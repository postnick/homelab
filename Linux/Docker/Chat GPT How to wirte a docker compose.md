## Prompt:  - First Pass
Can you give me a beginners guide as to how to write a docker compose yaml file. Something I can use for notes when building my own files in the future.

## Output:  - Fisrt Pass

Certainly! Here is a beginner's guide to writing a Docker Compose YAML file:

## Step 1: Define the version

The first thing you need to do when writing a Docker Compose YAML file is to define the version you're using. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your file:

```
version: '3'
```

This tells Docker Compose which version of the Compose file format you're using. You can use version 1, 2, or 3, depending on your needs. Version 3 is the most recent and supports the most features.

## Step 2: Define the services

The next step is to define the services that you want to run using Docker Compose. A service is a container that runs a specific application or process. You define services using the `services` section of the YAML file, like this:

```
services:
  myapp:
    image: myimage
```

In this example, we're defining a service called `myapp` that runs an image called `myimage`. You can specify any valid Docker image that you want to run as a service.

## Step 3: Define the container configuration

Once you've defined your service, you can configure the container that runs the service. You can do this by adding configuration options to the service definition, like this:

```
services:
  myapp:
    image: myimage
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

In this example, we're exposing port 80 on the container and mapping it to port 8080 on the host machine. We're also mounting a volume from the host machine to the container.

## Step 4: Define environment variables

You can also define environment variables that will be available to the container by adding an `environment` section to the service definition, like this:

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myimage
    environment:
      DB_HOST: db
      DB_USER: myuser
      DB_PASSWORD: mypassword
```

In this example, we're defining three environment variables that will be available to the container.

## Step 5: Define dependencies

If your application has dependencies on other services, you can define those dependencies using the `depends_on` option, like this:

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myimage
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
```

In this example, we're defining a dependency on a PostgreSQL database service called `db`.

## Step 6: Run the services

Once you've defined your services and configuration options, you can start the services using the `docker-compose up` command:

``` bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start all the services defined in your Docker Compose YAML file. You can use the `-d` flag to start the services in the background, like this:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

I hope this beginner's guide helps you get started with writing your own Docker Compose YAML files!

## Prompot: - Second Pass
Can you give me a beginners guide as to how to write a docker compose yaml file. Something I can use for notes when building my own files in the future. Be sure to add a section about how to use NFS for volumes and storage.

## Output: - Second Pass

Sure, here's a beginner's guide to writing a Docker Compose YAML file!

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The YAML file is used to specify the services that make up your application, as well as any associated networks, volumes, and other configurations.

Here are the basic steps to create a Docker Compose YAML file:

1. Define your services: Start by defining the different services that make up your application. Each service should be given a name, and its image should be specified.

For example, let's say you want to create a web application with a front-end and a back-end. Your YAML file might look something like this:

```yaml 
version: '3'

services:
  frontend:
    image: my-frontend-image:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  backend:
    image: my-backend-image:latest
```

This YAML file defines two services: `frontend` and `backend`. The `image` key specifies the Docker image for each service, and the `ports` key maps the container's port 80 to the host machine's port 80 for the `frontend` service.

2. Configure volumes: If your application requires persistent data, you can use volumes to store it outside of the container.

For example, let's say you want to store the data for your application in a directory on the host machine. You can use the `volumes` key to map the directory to a directory in the container.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  frontend:
    image: my-frontend-image:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
  backend:
    image: my-backend-image:latest
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
```

This YAML file adds a `volumes` key to each service. The `./data` directory on the host machine is mapped to the `/app/data` directory in each container.

3. Configure networks: If your services need to communicate with each other, you can use networks to connect them.

For example, let's say you want to create a network called `my-network` that the services can use to communicate with each other.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  frontend:
    image: my-frontend-image:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    networks:
      - my-network
  backend:
    image: my-backend-image:latest
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    networks:
      - my-network

networks:
  my-network:
```

This YAML file adds a `networks` key to each service, which specifies the `my-network` network. The `networks` key is also defined at the bottom of the file.

4. Using NFS for volumes and storage: To use NFS for volumes and storage, you can add an `nfs` driver to your YAML file.

For example, let's say you want to use an NFS server at `192.168.1.100` with a shared directory called `/mnt/nfs/data` to store the data for your application. You can use the `nfs` driver to map the directory to a directory in the container.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  frontend:
    image: my-frontend-image:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - nfs-data:/app/data
    networks:
      - my-network
  backend:
    image: my-backend-image:latest
    volumes:
      - nfs-data:/app/data
    networks:
      - my-network

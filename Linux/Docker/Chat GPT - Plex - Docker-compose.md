Certainly! Here is an example `docker-compose.yml` file that you can use to set up a Plex instance:

rubyCopy code

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  plex:
    image: plexinc/pms-docker
    container_name: plex
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - PLEX_CLAIM=claim-<your-claim-token>
    volumes:
      - /path/to/plex/config:/config
      - /path/to/media:/data
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
```


In this example, we're using the `plexinc/pms-docker` image to set up the Plex instance. We're giving the container a name of `plex` and setting it to restart automatically unless stopped. We're also using the host network mode to ensure that the container can access the network resources it needs.

The `environment` section includes several environment variables that you can customize to your needs. The `PUID` and `PGID` variables set the user and group IDs for the container, while the `TZ` variable sets the time zone. The `PLEX_CLAIM` variable is a unique token that you can obtain from the Plex website to claim your Plex server and link it to your account.

The `volumes` section maps local directories on your machine to directories in the container. `/path/to/plex/config` is where the Plex configuration will be stored, `/path/to/media` is where your media files will be stored, and `/etc/localtime` ensures that the container uses the correct time zone.

Once you've created the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can run the following command to start the Plex instance:

Copy code

`docker-compose up -d`

This will start the container in the background (`-d` flag) and keep it running even if you close your terminal. You should then be able to access the Plex web interface by going to `http://localhost:32400/web`.
